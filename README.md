# Zelf Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for **Zelf Name Service (ZNS)** - the world's first commercialized Zero Knowledge Face Proof™ system.

## About Zelf

Zelf Name Service (ZNS) is a revolutionary way of seed phrase (mnemonic key) storage, featuring cutting-edge privacy-preserving non-biometric encryption. This innovative wallet management solution ensures security without storing or exposing biometric data. The end user's face generates a unique, non-biometric binary representation called **ZelfProof**, which facilitates highly secure encryption and decryption.

### Key Features

- **🔒 No Biometric Storage**: Biometric data is never stored - only used to generate encrypted, randomized, privacy-preserving binary representations
- **👁️ Liveness Detection**: Verifies end user presence, preventing spoofing attempts
- **📱 Offline Capability**: Works both online and offline, requiring no internet connection
- **💾 Easy Storage**: Store private information in QR codes containing ZelfProof, with optional IPFS backup
- **🔄 Revocable**: ZelfProofs can be revoked and regenerated for enhanced security
- **🌐 Distributed**: Supports fully offline verification for decentralized systems

## Development

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Local Development

```bash
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server at `http://localhost:3000`. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static content hosting service.

### Deployment

Using SSH:

```bash
USE_SSH=true npm run deploy
```

Not using SSH:

```bash
GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> npm run deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
