## Key Features

### 1. Passwordless Authentication

SmartAccess supports multiple methods of passwordless authentication to enhance security and user experience:

* **Email Verification:** Once an email address is provided, a one-time password (OTP) is sent to the email provider to authenticate the end user.
* **Phone Verification:** Once a phone number is provided, a one-time password (OTP) is sent via SMS or WhatsApp to authenticate the end user.
* **Biometric Authentication:** By combining facial recognition (FR) and liveness detection (LD), users can safely verify their identity and give proof of humanity.

### 2. Flexible Configuration

SmartAccess allows businesses to configure the authentication process to their specific needs. Configure the minimum liveness and search scores for biometric verification, choose between fast or accurate search options, and can also suggest end users to do **Biometric Authentication** for a smoother experience.

## Getting Started

### 1. Basic Configuration

<img src="/img/smartaccess/basic-configuration.png" alt="Basic Configuration" />

In the **Basic Configuration** step, you will lay the foundation for your SmartAccess project. This step involves entering crucial project information that will dictate how your authentication processes are managed and what users can expect. Here's what you can customize:

* **Project Name:** Start by giving your project a unique and descriptive name. This will help you identify and manage your projects easily, especially if you plan to run multiple projects through SmartAccess.
* **Allowed Countries:** SmartAccess allows you to specify which countries your project will support. You can choose from a wide range of countries, ensuring that your authentication services are tailored to the geographical regions where your users are located. This feature is particularly useful for businesses with an international presence, as it allows you to comply with local regulations and standards.
* **Contact Information:** Enter the details of your Data Protection Officer (DPO). This includes the name, email, and address. This information is critical for maintaining compliance with data protection regulations, such as GDPR, and ensures that your users have a point of contact for privacy-related inquiries.
* **Privacy Policy & Terms and Conditions URLs:** SmartAccess gives you the flexibility to link to your existing Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions. This step ensures that users are fully informed about how their data will be used and the terms under which they can use your services. You can update these links at any time, providing agility to adapt to evolving legal requirements or company policies.

This initial setup provides a solid base, ensuring that all subsequent steps align with your project's specific needs and regulatory obligations.

### 2. Configure Login Methods

The **Login Methods** step is where you define how your users will authenticate themselves. SmartAccess offers a robust range of options that you can customize extensively to meet your business requirements:

* **Email Verification:** Enable or disable email-based authentication. If enabled, you can customize how the email OTPs (One-Time Passwords) are generated and sent. This includes setting the expiration time for OTPs, customizing the email templates to reflect your brand, and deciding whether to require additional verification steps, such as two-factor authentication (2FA).
* **Phone Verification:** SmartAccess supports phone-based verification via SMS and WhatsApp. You can choose to enable one or both options depending on your user base's preferences. Customize the messaging format, language, and delivery time to ensure a seamless experience. Additionally, you can configure fallback options in case the primary method fails, such as sending a second OTP through a different channel.

#### Biometric Authentication

<img src="/img/smartaccess/biometric-authentication.png" alt="Biometric Authentication" />

* **Biometric Authentication:** The platform's biometric capabilities allow users to log in using facial recognition. You have significant control over how this process works:
  * **Liveness Score:** Customize the threshold for liveness detection. This score determines how stringent the system is in verifying that the biometric input is from a live person, not a static image or video.
  * **Search Score:** This score sets the accuracy in search criteria (1:N) of facial recognition. A higher score means an more security, stricter matching criteria, and demands a higher resemblance to the user in order to gain access. The recommended score for optimal performance is 85%.

The **Connect Database** step is crucial for integrating SmartAccess with your existing user data. This step offers considerable flexibility, allowing you to connect your project to different data sources and ensure seamless operation:

* **API Integration:** Link your customer database with SmartAccess via an API. You'll need to provide the API URL and specify the data type you wish to query (e.g. email, phone number). SmartAccess offers a built-in test feature that allows you to check if the API is correctly linked. This test function is highly customizable—you can simulate different data queries to ensure your system is prepared for real-world use.
* **CSV Upload:** For those who prefer or require it, SmartAccess also supports the bulk upload of customer data through CSV files. This method is ideal for companies transitioning from older systems or those without a readily available API. Once uploaded, the system processes the CSV data, making it instantly accessible for authentication purposes.
