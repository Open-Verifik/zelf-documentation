# Service Level Agreement

### **Service Level Agreement**

#### **1. Service Channels. The User shall have access to the following Verifik service channels:**

1. Chat available on [Verifik.co](http://verifik.co)
2. Email: support@verifik.co
3. Customer service WhatsApp channel.
4. Customer service Discord channel.

#### **2. Hours of Operation**

The User will be able to access the support provided by Verifik, Monday through Friday (business days) from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM Colombia time.

#### **3. Criticality Levels**

The requests or requirements raised by Users to the support team will be classified according to the impact they have on the User's operation, as follows:

| **Critical:** | Total service unavailability.                                                |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Urgent:**   | Loss of specific functionality for all use cases.                            |
| **Medium:**   | Loss of functionality in specific cases.                                     |
| **Normal:**   | Other requests or general inquiries that do not affect Service Availability. |

#### **4. Response Times**

1. **Definitions:** Terms used in this section, shall have the following meanings:

```
i. Attention: The time elapsed between the request or requirement and the assignment of a service agent.
ii. Review: The time elapsed between the agent's greeting and the first response regarding the request or requirement.
iii. Escalation: The time elapsed between the agent's escalation and the case review by the person to whom it was escalated. This time only applies in events where it is necessary to escalate the user's request or requirement.
iv. Resolution: The time elapsed between the agent's greeting and the moment the case is resolved.
```

The response time varies according to the criticality of the requirement, as follows:

| **SEVERITY/TIME** | **ATTENTION** | **REVIEW** | **ESCALATION** | **RESOLUTION** |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ---------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| **Critical**      | 0.5 hr        | 0.5 hr     | 15 mins        | 48 hrs         |
| **Urgent**        | 0.5 hr        | 0.5 hr     | 15 mins        | 48 hrs         |
| **Medium**        | 1 hr          | 1 hr       | 0.5 hr         | 96 hrs         |
| **Normal**        | 1 hr          | 1 hr       | 0.5 hr         | 96 hrs         |

**Note:** 48 hrs means we take up to 48 hours to resolve the incident depending on its complexity.

Response times will be counted from the last message sent by the user.

#### **5. Platform Availability**

The Platform will be available at least:

| **Product**  | **Availability**                                                                                      | **Notes**                                                              |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SmartCHECK   | 90.0% > Data API                                                                                      | Data API depends on connections with Government Sources                |
| smartACCESS  | 99.0% > Email/Tel<br/>98.0% > Biometrics                                                    |                                                                        |
| smartENROLL  | 99.0% > Email/Tel<br/>98.0% > Biometrics<br/>98.0% > Document Scanning<br/>90.0% > Data API | Data API depends on connections with Government Sources                |

##### **5.1. Endpoint-Specific Availability Exclusions**

Due to the historical unpredictable operational availability characteristics of certain external data sources, specific endpoints are excluded from the Platform Availability commitments and Downtime Compensation provisions of this Agreement.

The following endpoints are excluded:

- Mexico – INE Validation
- Mexico – Vehicle Plate Validation

Interruptions, maintenance periods, degraded performance, delayed responses, or temporary unavailability affecting these endpoints shall not:

- be considered Platform Downtime;
- be included in Platform Availability calculations;
- qualify for Service Credits or any other compensation under this Agreement.

Verifik will continue to make commercially reasonable efforts to maintain connectivity and restore service whenever possible; however, no uptime guarantee is provided for the endpoints listed above.

#### **6. Downtime Compensation**

Credit Compensation awarded for the affected month will be provided in the form of a credit equivalent to the cost of the failed service call. If the service unavailability is caused by **Internal Issues** of Verifik (database, servers, internal API issues) and is not effectively resolved by the Company, Verifik will compensate as follows:

| **Service Availability**                                                                                            | **Credit Compensation**               | **Product**                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Data API (Data Query)**<br/>90.00% or higher<br/>89.99% or lower               | No Credit<br/>Compensation | smartCHECK                        |
| **Email/Tel**<br/>99.00% or higher<br/>98.99% or lower                           | No Credit<br/>Compensation | smartACCESS<br/>smartENROLL |
| **Biometrics**<br/>98.00% or higher<br/>97.99% or lower                          | No Credit<br/>Compensation | smartACCESS<br/>smartENROLL |
| **Document Scanning**<br/>98.00% or higher<br/>97.99% or lower                   | No Credit<br/>Compensation | smartENROLL<br/>smartACCESS |

**Internal Issues** of the Data API service (Data Query) excludes issues considered Force Majeure (Fortuitous Events), whether due to migration, disconnection, or external intervention by the governments that manage the databases. Verifik is an intermediary and therefore does NOT have control over the queried databases.

#### **7. Charging Scheme for smartCHECK**

The charging scheme applies to the smartCHECK solution, which enables queries to government databases. Verifik does not own, manage, or bear responsibility for (does not control or update) the government databases of the various countries we serve; therefore, Verifik reserves the right not to offer guarantees regarding Response Time, Average Up Time, or Data Accuracy.

If the query returns a **200** or **404**, it will be charged. Otherwise, if the query returns **403**, **409**, **412**, **422**, or **500**, it will not be charged.

| **Charged** | **Not Charged** |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| 200         | 403             |
| 404         | 409             |
|             | 412             |
|             | 422             |
|             | 500             |

#### **8. Dynamic Query for smartCHECK Service**

As part of the standard architecture of the smartCHECK Service, Verifik implements a Dynamic Query mechanism designed to maximize service availability, coverage, and reliability across supported endpoints.

The Dynamic Query mechanism allows smartCHECK and DB Screening to automatically and sequentially query multiple authorized data sources in cases where the primary data source returns an unsuccessful response, including but not limited to "Not Found" or equivalent HTTP 400-level responses. This architecture is intended to improve the probability of obtaining a successful verification result by leveraging multiple eligible data sources.

The Client acknowledges and agrees that the quality, completeness, and availability of governmental databases may vary significantly by jurisdiction, and that certain databases may present a higher probability of unsuccessful responses due to incomplete records, service interruptions, or limited data coverage.

To mitigate these limitations, Dynamic Query is enabled by default across all applicable smartCHECK endpoints and forms an integral part of Verifik's redundancy and failover strategy. This mechanism allows Verifik to maintain closer to one hundred percent (100%) service uptime and coverage on certain endpoints by dynamically routing requests to alternative available sources when necessary.

The Client further acknowledges and agrees that:

a) Dynamic Query is intended to increase the likelihood of successful verification responses but does not guarantee a successful match in all cases;

b) Response times may vary and, in some cases, be longer than standard single-source queries due to the cascading nature of multiple source requests;

c) The effectiveness and availability of Dynamic Query remain subject to the uptime, accessibility, and data quality of the underlying third-party or governmental sources; and

d) Verifik reserves the right to modify, prioritize, or substitute data sources within the Dynamic Query architecture at its sole discretion in order to maintain service continuity, optimize coverage, and improve verification performance.

Dynamic Query shall be considered an inherent feature of the smartCHECK Service and shall apply automatically to all Clients using eligible endpoints, unless otherwise specified in writing by Verifik.

#### **8.1 Dynamic pricing (billing)** {#dynamic-pricing-billing}

When Dynamic Query uses an extended verification path on an eligible endpoint and returns a successful match (**HTTP 200**), **dynamic pricing** may apply. In that case, credits are deducted at the **premium tier** for that endpoint family—not at the standard tier associated with the base route.

Dynamic pricing applies today to the standard Colombia national ID endpoint (**`GET/POST /v2/co/cedula`**) when an extended verification path completes successfully after standard paths do not return a match. Credit amounts depend on the **Client's configured feature pricing** (standard rate vs. premium rate for that endpoint family).

Dynamic pricing **does not** change section **7** charge rules: validation and server errors (**403**, **409**, **412**, **422**, **500**) are not charged; **404** responses are charged at the standard tier when no successful match is returned across applicable paths.

For transparency, the Client may pass **`includeCost=true`** on eligible requests to receive a **`billing`** object when credits are charged (including when dynamic pricing applies). API request history records adjustment metadata (for example, standard vs. charged amounts).

Calling **`/v2/co/cedula/premium`** directly always uses premium pricing; dynamic pricing describes automatic escalation from the standard **`/v2/co/cedula`** route.

See [Colombia National ID (basic)](/identity-validation/colombia/colombian-citizen#dynamic-pricing) for API details.

#### **9. Platform Unavailability**

Scheduled maintenance windows will take place at night and/or on weekends, with prior notification via email to users.

#### **10. New Adaptations or Developments**

The timeframes for developing new adaptations due to unexpected changes from User systems integrating via API with the Platform will vary according to the changes required by the User and will not count as Platform Downtime.
